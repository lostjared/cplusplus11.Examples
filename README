Jared Bruni's C++11 Examples 

I have created a series of C++ Tutorials in video form on YouTube
You can find them here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUgo--lX2kmqPQ5C8jRfy6RZVKHFqN7Zz

I am just going through and writing stuff to help me remember and practice
some of the new features of C++11. I will create a new repo for C++14.

Most of the examples do not do anything 
useful except to demonstrate those specific features. Some of the examples solve problems
like generating m3u playlist or outputting html for a cgi program.

There is also a calculator for parsing expressions that is similar to
the one from "The C++ Programming Language" 4th Edition. 

To build from Makefiles use 

on MacOS X:

$ make

on Linux:

$ make -f Makefile.linux

Note:
To compile make sure your compiler supports C++11 with clang I use:
say for sourcefile.cc

clang++ -std=c++11 sourcefile.cc -o sourcefile 

For Linux use libstdc++ instead of libc++ and g++ 4.8 or greater
Each program only requires one line to compile it. 

g++ -std=c++11 sourcefile.cc -o sourcefile
