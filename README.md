# Jared Bruni's C++11 Examples

This collection is my way of navigating through, and reinforcing my understanding of, C++11's new functionalities. I no longer plan to write a repository for C++14 as I have one for C++17.

The primary purpose of these examples is to showcase specific C++11 features rather than to provide practical utility. However, a few examples are designed to address real tasks, such as creating m3u playlists or generating HTML for CGI applications.

Included among the examples is a calculator that parses expressions, reminiscent of the one featured in "The C++ Programming Language" 4th Edition.

## Compilation Instructions:

### For MacOS X:

```
$ make
```

### For Linux:

```
$ make -f Makefile.linux
```

## Compilation Note:
Ensure your compiler is C++11 compatible. When using clang, for instance, compile a source file with:

```
clang++ -std=c++11 sourcefile.cc -o sourcefile
```

On Linux, opt for libstdc++ and use g++ version 4.8 or newer. Compiling any program requires just a single line:

```
g++ -std=c++11 sourcefile.cc -o sourcefile
```
