# C++ Examples for UNIX/Linux Systems

Welcome to our collection of C++ examples designed to demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques on UNIX/Linux operating systems. This repository serves as a practical resource for developers working within the UNIX/Linux ecosystem.

Historical Context: The UNIX Operating System
The UNIX operating system is a powerful, multi-user environment that has been at the heart of software development since its inception in the late 1960s. Developed at AT&T's Bell Labs, UNIX introduced many innovations that have shaped computing as we know it today. Its philosophy of "everything is a file" and the development of a hierarchical file system laid the groundwork for many operating systems that followed. Over the years, UNIX has evolved through various versions and inspired the creation of numerous operating systems, including Linux and MacOS, each adopting and adapting its core principles to serve modern computing needs.

Compiling the Examples
This repository is structured to accommodate development on UNIX-based systems, including Linux and MacOS X, with specific instructions for compiling the provided examples.

MacOS X Users:
To compile the examples on MacOS X, a UNIX-based OS, you can simply use the make command in the terminal:

    $ make

This command utilizes the default Makefile to compile the examples suitable for MacOS X.

Linux Users:
For those on Linux, we provide a specialized Makefile (Makefile.linux) that includes additional examples and possibly necessary modifications for Linux compilation:

    $ make -f Makefile.linux
Use this command to ensure compatibility and access to the extended set of examples specifically curated for Linux environments.

About This Repository
These examples aim to support both educational purposes for those learning C++ and UNIX/Linux system programming and as a reference for more experienced developers. We encourage contributions and feedback to help expand and refine this collection.

Enjoy exploring the capabilities of C++ on UNIX/Linux systems!
